# Eyes-Diseases-Detctor

# Plan of attack
* The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
- numpy==1.18.5
- Pillow==8.0.0
- streamlit==0.69.2
- tensorflow==2.3.1

* Most people have eye problems at one time or another. Some are minor and will go away on their own, or are easy to treat at home. Others need a specialist’s care.

* This program is designed to predict certain eye diseases such as Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy and Redness.We have collected the data needed for this project online and trained a model that can detect the disease that has infected the eye with up to 99% accuracy. 
# DataSet 
we collect the data from [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k)
# Red Eyes 'Redness'
* Your eyes look bloodshot. Why? . Their surface is covered in blood vessels that expand when they’re irritated or infected. That gives your eyes the red look , Eyestrain can do it, and so can a late night, a lack of sleep, or allergies. If an injury is the cause, get it checked by your Eyes Diseases Detctor App

# Cataract
* Cataracts are caused by a build-up of protein in the eye, and usually develop because of old age. However they can also appear as a result of eye injuries or following eye surgery for other problems. They can also be present from birth: in many poorer countries, where healthcare and treatment may be less readily available, childhood cataracts can be a major cause of blindness.

# Diabetic Retinopathy
* Diabetic retinopathy, also known as diabetic eye disease (DED), is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus. It is a leading cause of blindness in developed countries.
Diabetic retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more. At least 90% of new cases could be reduced with proper treatment and monitoring of the eyes. The longer a person has diabetes, the higher his or her chances of developing diabetic retinopathy. Each year in the United States, diabetic retinopathy accounts for 12% of all new cases of blindness. It is also the leading cause of blindness in people aged 20 to 64.
